function dtau=Oscillatory2SSDelayderivatives(ind,xx,par,nx,np) 
    
%The output of this function is dtau, which, depending on what derivative 
%is required, returns a certain derivative of a given delay.
%The idea of derivative functions within the set_funcs structure (both for the right hand side and the delays) is we take 
%partial derivatives with respect the dependent variables (not delayed and delayed), 
%parameters and mixtures of dependent variables (not delayed and 
%delayed) and parameters.

%In this function we are doing the above with the delays in our system:
%  Delay 1 = tau2,
%  Delay 2 = tau1+tau2.
 
%The variable nx within this function is a vector with either one element 
%(if only a first derivative is calculated) or two elements (if a second 
%derivative is calculated) and tells us about differentiation of the delays with respect to the %dependent variables in the system. Recall in the statement of the right hand side 
%we expressed our dependent variables in the form xx(A,B), where the value 
%of B indicated whether the dependent variable is not delayed or delayed, 
%and if delayed, the value of B tells us by which delay in our system (as detailed in sections 24 %and 28 of the Manual Help). The 
%elements of nx tell us by what “state”
%of the dependent variable we are going to differentiate with respect to. The notion of “state of %the dependent variable" will be used throughout this code, where a given state is when a dependent %variable is not delayed or delayed by the first delay or delayed by the second delay etc. 


%The variable np within this function is a vector with one element. This
%element is the index of the parameter in the parameter vector we 
%differentiate with respect to. 


%We start off by initialising dtau as empty. 
    
 dtau =[];
 
if length(nx)==1 && isempty(np)
     
     %This is saying consider the case when nx is of length 1 (so
     %differentiation with respect to the dependent variables occurs once)
     %and when np is empty (so no differentiation with respect to a 
     %parameter occurs). In the same way that the value of B goes up as we
     %go from no delay to the first delay to the second delay etc, the
     %value of nx goes up from 0 (differentiation with respect to the 
     %dependent variables with no delay) to 1 (differentiation with respect 
     %to the dependent variables with the first delay) to 2 
     %(differentiation with respect to the dependent variables with the 
     %second delay) etc.


     %We consider the differentiation of each delay in turn, indicated by 
     %the value of ind. For this case, where we are looking at taking the first 
     %derivative with respect to the dependent variables only. For every 
%differentiation with respect to the dependent variables in a given state, 
%dtau is a row vector with n columns (where n is the number of 
%dependent variables). So for this model, it is a row vector with 2 
%columns. For the given delay we consider, the first column is that 
%delay differentiated with respect to the first dependent variable, J, and  
%the second column is that delay differentiated with respect to the
%second dependent variable, A. The actual value of nx tells us what form 
%of the dependent variables we are differentiating with respect to.

% This is saying consider the case when nx is of length 2 (so

% and when np is empty (so no differentiation with respect to a

% each delay, we look at each of the first derivatives of that delay and 
% differentiate them again with respect to the dependent variables with 
% no delay, then with respect to the dependent variables with the first 
% delay, then with respect to the dependent variables with the second 
% delay. 

%We consider the differentiation of each delay in turn, indicated by 
%the value of ind. For the case where we are looking at
%two differentiations with respect to the dependent variables, for 
%every combination of derivatives, dtau is a nxn matrix where n is the 
%number of dependent variables. Across the rows of each matrix, the
%thing you are differentiating remains constant (the thing being the 
%first derivative of that delay with respect to a given dependent variable in a given state), but %the dependent variable you differentiate with respect to changes across 
%the columns (while the state of these variables remains fixed). The rows represent the first derivative of that delay differentiated by a different dependent 
%variables (but in a fixed state) of the system.
