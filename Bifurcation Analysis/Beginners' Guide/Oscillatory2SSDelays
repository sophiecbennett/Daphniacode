%This is the function that returns the values of the delays in the system. 


% tau is the output representing a delay. We vary the value of ind through
% an if statement, where ind represents the index of a delay in the list of
% the delays. 


%The delays for this model are tau2 and (tau1+tau2), thus, tau2 has index 1
%and (tau1+tau2) has index 2 in the list of delays. This order of the
%delays with the delay list must remain throughout the entirety of your
%code. 


% Remember, even though our second delay is of the state dependent kind, the
% first is not, and so it appears in the parameter vector as well as within this function.


function tau=Oscillatory2SSDelays(ind,xx,par) 
    if ind ==1 %When our bifurcation diagram code requires the first delay
    tau=par(5); % tau (the output of the function) takes the value of tau2
    elseif ind ==2 %When our bifurcation diagram code requires the second delay
    tau=par(5)+ par(6); % tau (the output of the function) takes the value of (tau1+tau2)
    end 
end


%Notice here that the variable input xx is unused in this specific
%function, because none of the delays in the system we are considering
%depend on the dependent variables of the system, but I have left it in here
%to demonstrate that the delays are allowed to depend upon the dependent
%variables.
