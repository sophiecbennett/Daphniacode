%This is the code that calculates the stability of periodic orbit branches. The output is a row vector, that here I have called “stability_indicator”. Each point in the vector corresponds to a point on your periodic orbit branch. If point x in the vector is equal to 0, the corresponding periodic point is stable. If point x in the vector is equal to 1, the corresponding periodic point is unstable. 

tol=1e-9;


stability_indicator=zeros(length(NAME_OF_BRANCH_HERE),1);


for i=1:length(NAME_OF_BRANCH_HERE.point)
       
      if abs(NAME_OF_BRANCH_HERE(i).stability.mu(1))>1+tol
          stability_indicator(i)=1;
      else
          stability_indicator(i)=0;
      end
end
