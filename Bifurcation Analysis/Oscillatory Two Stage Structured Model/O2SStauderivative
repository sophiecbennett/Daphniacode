function dtau=O2SStauderivative(ind,xx,par,nx,np) 
    
%The output of this function is dtau. This is a vector with the number
%of elements is the number of delays. Depending on what we diferentiate
%each delay by, the values of the elements of dtau will be different. 
%This idea of these derivative functions is we take partial derivatives 
%with repect the dependent variables (not delayed and delayed), 
%parameters and mixtures of dependent variables (not delayed and 
%delayed) and parameters.


%In this function we are doing the above with the delays in our system:
%  Delay 1 = tau2,
%  Delay 2 = tau1+tau2.


%We start off by initialising dtau as empty. 
    
 dtau =[];
 
%Recall in the statement of the right hand side we expressed our variables
%in the form xx(A,B), where the value of B indicated whether the dependent
%variable is not delayed or delayed, and if delayed, the value of B tells
%us by which delay in our system. Here, the variable nx is a vector whos
%elements take the value of B, as they tell us by what state of the
%dependent variable we are going to differentiate with respect to. Every
%element of nx represents one differentiation with respect to the state of
%the dependent variable each element indicates. 


%The same applies with the vector np, although np represents
%differentiation with repsect to a parameter. 
 
if length(nx)==1 && isempty(np)
     
     % This is saying consider the case when nx is of length 1 (so
     % differentiation with respect to the dependent variable occurs once)
     % and when np is empty (so no differentiation with respect to a 
     % parameter occurs). In the same way that the value of B goes up as we
     % go from no delay to the first delay to the second delay etc, the
     % value of nx goes up from 0 (differentiation with respect to no
     % delay) to 1 (differentiation with respect to the first delay) to 2 
     % (differentiation with respect to thr second delay) etc.


     %For every delay we consider (indicated by the value of dtau) the
     %output of this function is dtau. For the case where we are looking at
     %one derivative with respect to the independent variable only, dtau is
     %a row vector with A columns (one for each dependent variable). For
     %the given delay we consider, the first column is that delay
%differentiatied with repect to the first dependent variable, the
%second column is that delay differentiayted with respect to the
%second dependent variable etc etc. The actual value of nx tells us
%what form of the dependent variables we are differentiating with
%respect to. 


if nx==0 % This means derivative of each delay with respect to the dependent variable with no delay

%Since all our delays are independent of dependent variables not delayed, dtau
%is just a row of zeros for both delays.

dtau=zeros(1,2);
